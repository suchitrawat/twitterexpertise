# twitterexpertise
The following source code is used to pre-process, wrangle, and analyse a "twitter expertise" dataset.    
The aim of this project is to understand how users that are identified as experts on Twitter use the platform differently to those who are not identified as experts and to then predict the userâ€™s expertise based on the observed differences.
